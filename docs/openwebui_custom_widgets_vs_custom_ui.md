# Custom UI Development: OpenWebUI vs. Bespoke FastAPI Frontend

## 1. OpenWebUI Custom Widgets
### Capabilities
- React/TypeScript SPA with a plugin system; core renderers cover markdown, tables, basic rich text.
- Plugin API allows registering custom response renderers (e.g., parse JSON and render custom components) and server-side tools.
- To build calendars, code sandboxes, or other rich widgets you must implement React components, bundle them with the plugin, and keep them in sync with OpenWebUI’s build tooling.

### Effort & Maintenance
- Moderate to high effort for interactive views (calendar, code execution). Requires TypeScript expertise and understanding of OpenWebUI internals.
- Plugin API is still evolving; upstream updates can break custom widgets, so you need CI/tests to validate after each release.
- Deployment pipeline must rebuild the plugin and redeploy alongside OpenWebUI container updates.

### Constraints
- UI changes are limited to areas exposed by the plugin API; deep layout changes or new navigation patterns likely require forking the main UI.
- Security considerations for code-running widgets are significant (sandboxing, resource quotas) and not provided by default.

## 2. Bespoke FastAPI Frontend
### Capabilities
- Our existing `base_module_web` SPA loads plain HTML/JS/CSS (no framework) and calls FastAPI endpoints.
- We can add any widgets by writing vanilla JS (or a lightweight framework) and expanding API responses to feed them.
- Full control over layout, navigation, and data flow; we can expose agent-specific features (memory timeline, tool controls) without conforming to OpenWebUI conventions.

### Effort & Maintenance
- Initial development is straightforward for simple experiences; we already have a functioning prototype.
- Enhancements (calendar view, code runner) can be built incrementally using libraries (FullCalendar, xterm.js) and served statically.
- Maintenance burden is lower: no upstream dependency churn, only our own codebase to manage.

### Constraints
- Requires us to implement any desired features ourselves (user auth, collaboration, analytics), whereas OpenWebUI ships many niceties out of the box.
- Testing and tooling discipline must be enforced internally (CI, linting, component testing) since there’s no community framework scaffolding.

## 3. Comparison Summary
| Criteria | OpenWebUI | Custom FastAPI UI |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| **Time to basic UI** | Immediate (existing UI) | Already achieved with prototype |
| **Custom widget effort** | Medium/high; React plugin dev | Medium; vanilla JS or lightweight framework |
| **Maintenance** | Need to track upstream releases; plugin API churn | Fully owned; only our release cadence |
| **Feature breadth** | Rich ecosystem (prompt library, profiles, SSO integration) | Build as needed (auth, analytics, etc.) |
| **Brand control** | Limited without forking | Complete control |
| **Security** | Depends on OpenWebUI updates | Entirely under our policies |
| **Developer skillset** | React/TypeScript | Python + JS (flexible choice of stack) |

## 4. Recommendation
- Use OpenWebUI if stakeholders need the broad feature set immediately and we’re willing to invest in TypeScript plugins for niche renderers.
- For tailored experiences (calendar agendas, tool dashboards, custom memory views) with minimal maintenance overhead, continue investing in the FastAPI UI and add targeted widgets via plain JS or a lightweight framework.
- Hybrid option: run OpenWebUI for standard chat users, keep the bespoke UI for advanced workflows where deep customization matters.
